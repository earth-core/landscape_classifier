# landscape_classifier
A multi-class classification Convolutional Neural Net(CNN) on Intel Image Classification Dataset.

Data is divided into 6 classes i.e. Building, Forest, Street, Sea, Glacier and Mountain.
Data is divided into 11228 files for training,2806 files for validation and 3000 files for testing. 

This simple model achieves an accuracy of 77.8%.

Future improvements will/can be made using transfer learning and ensemble methods to find the best achievable result.
