# landscape_classifier
A multi-class classification Convolutional Neural Net(CNN) on Intel Image Classification Dataset.

Data is divided into 6 classes i.e. Building, Forest, Street, Sea, Glacier and Mountain.
Data is divided into 11228 files for training,2806 files for validation and 3000 files for testing.

This simple model achieves an accuracy of 77.8%.
Using Vgg16 model and transfer learning and training only the last layer model achieves accuracy of 88.1%. 

Future improvements will/can be made using ensemble methods and data augmentation to find the best achievable result.
